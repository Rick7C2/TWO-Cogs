# Installation

To install a cog on your bot instance:

## 1. Add the repo

`[p]cog repo add SML-Cogs https://github.com/Rick7C2/TWO-Cogs`

`[p]` stands for server prefix. So if you use `!` as to run bot commands, you would instead type:

`!cog repo add SML-Cogs https://github.com/Rick7C2/TWO-Cogs`

## 2. Add the cog you want to installed

`[p]cog install SML-Cogs deck`
